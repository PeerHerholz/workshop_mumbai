    "\n",
    "BIDS basically describes how you should organize and structure your data, which not only helps you, but also others when sharing your data (which is also eased up). This also allows hassle free applications of other workflows and pipelines which can work with BIDS datasets, increases reproducibility and simplifies collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these advantages there are a lot of tools which are intended to and ease up the work with BIDS datasets. A very good example is [pybids](https://github.com/INCF/pybids), which is incredibly useful for any kind of interaction with [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io) datasets, e.g. within a nice & reproducible [nipype](https://github.com/nipy/nipype) [workflow](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nipy/workshops/blob/master/170327-nipype/notebooks/basic-bids/basic_data_input_bids.ipynb). Make sure to also have a look at [bidsutils](https://github.com/INCF/bidsutils).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you should also check the already mentioned [BIDS apps](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io). These are \"portable neuroimaging pipelines that understand BIDS datasets\". More precisely, [BIDS apps](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/about/) are neuroimaging pipelines / workflows for a [huge variety of analyses](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/apps/) packed in a docker image that will work / run out of the box given a [BIDS dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201644) as input. It won't get any more comfortable (okay, maybe with [openneuro.org](https://openneuro.org)).\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, let's actually check out our dataset in even more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: if you decide to use any of the mentioned tools please show credit by citing them: [BIDS](https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.44), [BIDS apps](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005209)."

    "\n",
    "PyBIDS is a Python library to centralize interactions with datasets conforming BIDS format. It builds upon [Grabbit](https://github.com/grabbles/grabbit), which is a lightweight Python 2 and 3 package for simple queries over filenames within a project. It's geared towards projects or applications with highly structured filenames that allow useful queries to be performed without having to inspect the file metadata or contents. The included [grabbids](https://github.com/INCF/pybids/tree/master/bids/grabbids) is a BIDS-specific extension of grabbit that makes it particularly easy to work with BIDS projects, and provides additional functionality."
